##Features##

- Quick web search : search the web quickly using my bang@home search engine that allows you  to quickly navigate to and within
  websites with a single search using duckduckgo !bangs or your own custom made bangs: *https://bangathome.free.nf*

- Weather: weather for your location based on IP
- Quick apps: quickly open an app by hovering over the widget in the island (Terminal only right now as a POC)

- More to come!

This is a POC and is very early in its development, i really am making it for myself because i dont like how the notch doesnt really do anything, and will be experimenting with new features and improvments 
depending on how much i end up using it... if you see anything you think would make it cooler feel free to suggest it!
